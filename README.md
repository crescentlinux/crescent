# ðŸŒ™ crescent linux
simple, modern and pleasing. Crescent aims to bring an aesthetic Linux experience to your Mac computer with Apple M1/M2 series chip, while keeping THAT important balance between looks and performance.

crescent exists thanks to [Asahi Linux](https://asahilinux.org): an amazing project developed by the Asahi team that brings the world of Linux to Apple Silicon devices running macOS.
